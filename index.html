        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>My first language was Python. When I was about to start my journey with CSE , one of my close friend Saharukh told me to test Python. Then I tried and yes I started to like it because of its simplified syntax. I learnt the basics of Python
          and it takes a short time to learn. Thanks to my friend for assisting me with learning code in this easy way.</p>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>Then I started learning HTML. It was also suggested by my friend. He gave me a course about web development bootcamp. I have an interest on building new website. That's my first priority. Its fun to learn HTML. The basic structure of any website.</p>

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>After learning HTML its mendatory to know about CSS. Beacause if anyone want to style his website then CSS is compulsory. And its also easy to learn. I build this website with HTML and CSS. Thank you.</p>
